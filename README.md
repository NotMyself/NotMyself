# Bobby Johnson

**Chief Problem Solver & Agentic Engineer** · [NotMyself.IO LLC](https://notmyself.io) · Olympia, WA

I build systems where AI agents do real engineering work on their own. Not chatbot prompting, but parallel agents running through dependency-ordered workflows with quality gates. 25+ years turning the projects others avoid into shipped software.

Currently modernizing legacy systems at [**TailorWell**](https://tailorwell.com), a health insurance benefits platform for small employers and brokers. Previously 8 years at **Auth0/Okta** in identity, security, and developer education.

### What I'm Working On

- **Agentic AI Workflows** - Parallel agent orchestration with structural guardrails, quality gates, and dependency-ordered pipelines
- **Legacy System Modernization** - Migrating systems that have grown organically for years with minimal docs and tribal knowledge
- **Claude Code Ecosystem** - Building plugins, skills, and tooling for AI-assisted development
- **Knowledge Recovery** - Turning undocumented codebases into documented, maintainable systems
